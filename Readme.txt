# The-CBIR-Indexation-project
The aim of this work is to study and build a system for indexing and searching an image according to its content. In our study, after having noted the effectiveness of the representation of the contents of the image by its colour, we chose in this project to study this type of parameter to be able to represent the digital contents of the image. In the rest of this report, we present an application of our content-based image indexing and retrieval system and the indexing methods used. We conclude with a conclusion in which the main results obtained are presented. In this work, we are mainly interested in the search of images by their color
